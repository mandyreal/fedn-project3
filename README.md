Project 3 for Udacity's FEDN - Frogger Game clone 

Project Goal: Given the visual assets and game loop engine, recreate the classic arcade game Frogger by adding the required entities including the characters and enemies. 

Game Notes:
1. Using arrow keys, the goal of the game is to reach the water by crossing the stone path while avoiding the bugs that pass along.
2. Once water is reached, game moves to next level. Bugs move faster as the game level goes higher.
3. A random character is generated at the start of each new game.
4. Faster fingers are required as the game goes up to higher levels :)
5. Character has infinite number of lives :)

Special thanks to my fellow nanodegree cohort whose works provided helpful insights in understanding how to piece the objects together:
